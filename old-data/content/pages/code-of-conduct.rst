Community

**GNU/Linux Users Group** is the open-source community of the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India. GLUG is powered by a large number of open source and Linux enthusiasts. We share a common love for GNU/Linux and FOSS.  

As of now, GLUG is active on a Discord server. Currently, we only allow members who are a part of NIT Hamirpur and IIIT Una, may they be students, faculty, staff, or anyone belonging to these institutes. There is no prerequisite for joining GLUG. Everyone is welcome. You can get the invite link from an existing member of GLUG.  


Code of Conduct 
=============== 

As a community, we have a *Code of Conduct*, and we expect our members to follow them. Most of the rules are for the community server on Discord as most of our work happens there. 


Expected Behavior 
------------------ 

- As an open community we are open to any cast, gender, religion, ethnicity, and race. We expect all the members to respect any diversity and support each other. 
- GLUG is an evergreen and fun community, and we try to keep things very simple and fun. You are welcome with all the memes and fun to have, and we have dedicated channels for these activities. At the same time, we expect you to keep the channels in the **MAIN** as clean and free of spams. 
- Use of Sir/Ma'am in the server is highly unappreciated. GLUG treats everyone equally and we like to keep it as a developer-to-developer discussion. 
- Whenever asking any question please mention the context, errors, supporting screenshots, and source. Other than that, what things you have tried would be helpful for other people. 
- Please use the proper channel for any type of help or content. Promotion of college events is okay, but we expect you not to put anything that distracts members or is not in the community's best interests. 
  

Unexpected Behavior 
-------------------- 

- Any type of trolling, bullying, harassment, posting illegal and NSFW content is not welcome at all and can get you banned from the community forever. Please refrain from doing so and report to the moderators if you find anything inappropriate.  
- Since GLUG mostly consists of programmers and computer enthusiasts this is very common to ask questions from competitive programming contests and other events, and we make sure that you get your answer, but please don't ask questions from live contests, not even hints, wait for it to finish and you can ask whatever you want.  
- Do not send personal messages to any member without their approval (except moderators and admins). Any case related to this will be considered malpractice and can get you banned. 
  

How and where to report? 
------------------------   

- If you want to report any incident related to Discord Server, you can directly message any moderator or admin. They will help you resolve the issue. 
- While in the chat you can tag admins or moderators by **@admins** or **@moderators** to pull their attention to the issue. 
- For all other queries including the above you can mail to `csec@nith.ac.in <mailto:csec@nith.ac.in>`_. We will respond to you soon.  


Consequences of breaking code of conduct 
---------------------------------------- 

- Since GLUG-NITH is an open community, we do not want to ban anyone. But at the same time, we will not entertain any kind of misbehavior or breaking of rules. 
- More serious offenses can also be sent to the college authorities if needed.
