**GNU/Linux Users Group** is the open source community of National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India. GLUG is powered by large number of open source and linux enthusiats. We share a common love for GNU/Linux and FOSS. 


As of now GLUG is active on a Discord server. Currently we only allow members who are a part of NIT Hamirpur and IIIT Una, may they be students, faculty, staff or anyone belonging to these institutes. There is no prerequicite for joining GLUG. Everyone is welcome. You can get the invite link from any exisiting member of GLUG. 


As a community we have a *Code of Conduct*, and we expect our members to follow them. Most of the rules are for the community server on Discord as most of our work happens there. 

Code of Conduct
===============

1. As a open community we are open to any cast, gender, religion,  ethnicity and race. We expect all the members to respect any diversity and support each other.
2. Use of Sir/Ma'am in the server is highly unappreciated. GLUG treats everyone equally and we like to keep it as a developer-to-developer discussion.
3. GLUG is a evergreen and fun community, and we try to keep things very simple and fun. You are welcome with all the memes and fun contain, and we have dedicated channels for these activities. At the same time we expect you to keep the channels in the **MAIN** as clean and free of spams. 
4. Any type of trolling, bullying, harassment, posting illegal and NSFW content is not welcome at all and ca get you banned from the community forever. Please refrain from doing so and report to the moderators if you find anything inappropriate. 
5. Since GLUG mostly consists of programmers and computer enthusiasts this is very common to ask questions from competitive programming contests and other events, and we make sure that you get your answer, but please don't ask questions from live contests, not even hints, wait for it to finish and you can ask whatever you want. 
6. Whenever asking any question please mention the context, errors, supporting screenshots and source. Other than that what things you have tried would be helpful for other people.
