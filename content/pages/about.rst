**GLUG NITH** is a moniker for the GNU/Linux User Group of National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur.

Mission
-------

As the name (GLUG/Linux Users Group) says, our mission statement is clear, that is to aware people about Linux and open source and help them get started with programming and open source. Our GLUG is mainly designed to cater to the GNU/Linux-related needs of the students, faculty, staff, and anybody else belonging to NIT Hamirpur. We are a heterogenous mixture of people ranging from the beta testers and kernel hackers to the fresh-faced newbies, held together by a common love for GNU/Linux and Open Source.  

What is GNU?
------------

**In the words of Richard M. Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project**:

.. epigraph::

  "GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it. Several other volunteers are helping me. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed."
